# Inspiration
Our main inspiration was the danger of subway systems. Subways crimes are drastically increasing every year; one of the most used transportation systems is becoming unsafe. With the common occurrence of these crimes, the subway systems brought our incentive to improve the safety of its customers.

However, after realising that subway crimes were scarce except in New York, we decided to target the general incidents of abuse. Ideally placed in public areas such as restaurants, parking lots, and more, the Gesture Camera is our solution to abuse.

# What It Does
## Captures
* Gesture Camera detects the hand gesture, a quick movement of opening and closing the hand. This gesture will be used in immediate situations of danger where the victim is unable to or has difficulty getting help.

## Alerts
* The camera then secretly alerts the police, so they can track the location of the victim and bring them to safety as soon as possible. This procedure allows the victims to signal for help without the attention of the abuser.

## Protects
* Gesture Cameras are to be placed in public areas to protect people from all forms of abuse.

# Built With
With the use of python and mediapipe, we were able to make computers easily recognize the difference with each hand movement and distinguish the one in need.

Mediapipe was used to track hand movements. Python was used for coding the corresponding text, sending ‘Help!!!’ to the police, and taking a screenshot of the victim's current state of making the hand gesture.
